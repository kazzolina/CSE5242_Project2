**Professor:** Dr. John Paparrizos

**Group Members:** 

- Kaitlyn Azzolina

## Compilation Instructions

### Prerequisites

**Programming Language:** C

### Steps to Compile:

1. Compile the db5242.c using `gcc -O3 -mavx2 -o db5242 db5242.c`
2. Run the code by `./db5242`

#### Profiling the code of binary search:

Use **`./db5242 N X Y Z R`** to measure `bulk_bin_search` and `bulk_bin_search_4x` functions. In order to test that correctly, you will need to uncomment the code that you want to measure within `bulk_bin_search` and `bulk_bin_search_4x`

        Lines ...

**`N`:** number of elements in the array being searched (same as the number of probes) *varies from 10 to 10^7*

**`X, Y, Z`:** *not needed* (supply dummy values)

**`R`:** number of repeats of the experiment within the timing loop

#### Profiling the code of band join:

Use **`./db5242 N X Y Z`** to measure the performance of band_join and band_join_simd.

**`N`:** size of the inner (sorted) table

**`X`:** size of the outer table

**`Y`:** size of the output result being allocated

**`Z`:** bound being used in the band computation

**Note:** 

- The outer key must be within **`Z`** (inclusive) of the inner table value
- The outer table values are generated by the system as 31-bit random numbers that are independent of the values in the inner table
- For small Z values, you may not get any matches
